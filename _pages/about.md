I am a PhD candidate at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/ali.sayed?lang=en">Ali H. Sayed</a>.

My research focuses on **decision-making and learning from data in interconnected and modular systems**. Drawing inspiration from real-world applications, I aim to develop interpretable solutions with theoretical guarantees. To achieve this, I leverage techniques from machine learning, signal processing, network science, optimization, and control.
