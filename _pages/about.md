I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/">School of Computer and Communication Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/"> École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/ali.sayed?lang=en">Prof. Ali H. Sayed</a>.

My main research interest lies in **social intelligence**, as exemplified in nature by human social networks and bee swarms. In complement to the prevalent focus on developing advanced artificial *individual* intelligence, my goal is to create systems designed for an inherently interconnected and modular world. To achieve this, I leverage techniques from **machine learning**, **network science**, **signal processing**, **optimization**, and **control**, aiming to both understand and design the mechanisms of collective intelligence.
